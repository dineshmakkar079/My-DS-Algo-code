1. Bits related :- GCC exposes these instructions through the built-in functions 
__builtin_ctz (count trailing zeros) and __builtin_clz (count leading zeros). These are the 
most convenient way to find bit indices for C++ programmers in TopCoder. Be warned though: 
the return value is undefined for an argument of zero.

__builtin_clzl (for long)
__builtin_clzll (for long long)
__builtin_popcount -- how many bits are set
